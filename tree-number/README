Tony motivates his introduction of the State monad by looking a tree numbering problem. My first instinct would be to implement this imperatively (TreeNumberImperativeStyle.scala) but that doesn't help understand the state monad :). TreeNumber.scala is the solution solved "long hand" but in a functional style. It's equivalent to Tony's solution but easier for me to understand (I make use of a couple of intermediate vals in the number function).

Got the TreeNumberWithStateMonad.scala version going by lifting the State monad from Scalaz5. I've modified the examples so that they start numbering at the number given (not the number+1).
