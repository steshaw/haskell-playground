Program to be type checked:

Let
  a
    TpInt
    1
  b
    TpInt
    BinOpApp
      c
      Times
      2
  Let
    a
      TpInt
      BinOpApp
        b
        Greater
        4
    c
      TpBool
      BinOpApp
        a
        Less
        1
    If
      BinOpApp
        BinOpApp
          a
          Plus
          b
        Plus
        c
      BinOpApp
        a
        Less
        b
      0


There were errors:
Variable c is not defined.
Declared type int does not match inferred type bool
Ill-typed operator application: expected type int, got type bool
Ill-typed condition: expected bool, got int
Expected same type in both then and else branch, but got types bool and int
